# Overview  
This app allows you to rapidly find whether or not songs contain explicit lyrics. To use, simply configure your filter (which comes pre-equipped with not only the seven dirty words but several other common swears,) then use our search feature to hunt for a song. GrooveSweeper will then tell you what words in the lyrics violate your definition of explicit.

## Use
To use GrooveSweeper you simply need to run `python ./run.py` from the `groovesweeper.github.io/groovesweepersite` directory. You may need to refresh the browser window that is opened by this script.

## Dependencies  
GrooveSweeper relies upon lyricsgenius by John Miller (https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius). This will be automatically downloaded when you execute the run.py script for the first time. Otherwise it is available on PyPI and can be downloaded with `pip install lyricsgenius`  

## Development Information
